# Process Optimization and Simulation in Chemical Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains documentation on various simulation and process optimization projects I worked on during my BSc, MSc, and professional experiences in chemical engineering, with a focus on process improvements and computational modeling. Over the years, I have utilized advanced engineering software tools such as **MATLAB**, **Aspen HYSYS**, **ANSYS Fluent**, **OpenFOAM**, and **LIGGGHTS** to solve complex chemical engineering problems related to fluid dynamics, process optimization, energy efficiency, and system performance.

In most of my projects, the goal was to optimize and simulate industrial chemical processes and improve performance. This includes work on **Aspen HYSYS process simulation**, **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**, and **CFD-DEM coupling**, with a focus on simulating fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer in complex systems.

The following tools and software were utilized throughout these projects:

- **ANSYS Fluent**: Used for detailed **CFD** modeling of fluid flows, heat transfer, and chemical reactions in complex systems.
  
- **MATLAB**: Utilized for process simulation and optimization. MATLAB was also used to solve **Navier-Stokes equations** using the finite element methods (FEM) and Finite Volume Method (FVM)
 for velocity and heat transfer analysis.

- **Aspen HYSYS**: A powerful process simulation tool used to optimize chemical processes, including reactor design and energy balances in different process plants.

- **OpenFOAM**: Used for **CFD** simulations, particularly in two-phase flow systems with aim of the coupling with DEM for particle simulations.

- **LIGGGHTS**: Employed for **Discrete Element Method (DEM)** simulations, particularly in **CFD-DEM coupling** for simulating fluid-particle interactions in the presence of a magnetic field.
