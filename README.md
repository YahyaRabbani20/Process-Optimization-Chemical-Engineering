# Process Optimization and Simulation in Chemical Engineering (2010-2020)

## Overview
This repository documents various simulation and process optimization projects I worked on during my BSc, MSc, and professional experiences in chemical engineering, with a focus on process improvements and computational modeling. Over the years, I utilized advanced engineering software tools such as **MATLAB**, **Aspen HYSYS**, **ANSYS Fluent**, **OpenFOAM**, and **LIGGGHTS** to solve complex chemical engineering problems related to fluid dynamics, process optimization, energy efficiency, and system performance.
