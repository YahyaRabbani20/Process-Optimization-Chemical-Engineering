# Process Optimization and Simulation in Chemical Engineering (2010-2020)

## Overview
This repository documents various simulation and process optimization projects I worked on during my BSc, MSc and work experiences in Chemical Engineering, with a focus on process improvements and computational modeling. Over the years, I utilized several advanced engineering software tools such as **MATLAB**, **Aspen HYSYS**, and **ANSYS Fluent** to solve complex chemical engineering problems related to fluid dynamics, process optimization, and system efficiency.

### Purpose
The main goal of these projects was to simulate and optimize industrial processes using various computational tools, improving performance, safety, and sustainability. This included developing **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** models, conducting **process optimizations**, and exploring new methods to enhance process efficiency in chemical systems.
